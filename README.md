# Emacs-Config

My [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) (`.emacs`) configuration file. That's how i configure my emacs.

You are **free to use my configuration and modify it your likings**

And if for *some reason*, some *weird reason*, your brain decides to contribute to this shit, you can.

I will review any *PRs*.

I am using Emacs 27

## Required packages

[MELPA](https://melpa.org) is needed to install these.
