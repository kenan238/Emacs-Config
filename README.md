# Emacs-Config

My [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) (`.emacs`) configuration file. That's how i configure my emacs.

You are **free to use my configuration and modify it your likings**

And if for *some reason*, some *weird reason*, your brain decides to contribute to this shit, you can.

I will review any *PRs*.

## why did u create this
I created this so i can: 
- Share my configuration with people
- Transfer it from a computer to another

ok thx for reading now bye
